## <a name="intro"></a> Introduction
Many methods have been developed to detect transposable element (TE) insertions from whole genome shotgun next-generation sequencing (NGS) data, each of which has different dependencies, run interfaces, and output formats. Here, we have developed a meta-pipeline to install and run six methods for detecting TE insertions in NGS data, which generates output in the UCSC Browser extensible data (BED) format. A detailed description of the McClintock pipeline and evaluation of McClintock component methods on the yeast genome can be found in [Nelson, Linheiro and Bergman (2017) *G3* 7:2763-2778](http://www.g3journal.org/content/7/8/2763).

The complete pipeline requires a fasta reference genome, a fasta consensus set of TE sequences present in the organism and fastq paired end sequencing reads. Optionally if detailed annotation of the reference TE sequences has been performed, a GFF file with the locations of known TEs present in the reference genome and a tab delimited hierarchy file linking these individual insertions to the consensus they belong to (an example of this file is included in the test directory as sac_cer_te_families.tsv) can be supplied. If only single ended sequencing data are available then this can be supplied as option -1 however only ngs_te_mapper and RelocaTE will run as these are the only methods that handle it.

## <a name="dependency"></a> Software Dependencies
This system was designed to run on linux operating systems. Installation of software dependencies is automated by Conda, thus Conda is required to install McClintock. Conda can be installed via the [Miniconda installer](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh).

#### Installing Miniconda (Python 3.X)
```bash
wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O $HOME//miniconda.sh
bash ~/miniconda.sh -b -p $HOME/miniconda # silent mode
echo "export PATH=\$PATH:\$HOME/miniconda/bin" >> $HOME/.bashrc # add to .bashrc
source $HOME/.bashrc
conda init
```
* `conda init` requires you to close and open a new terminal before it take effect

#### Update Conda
```bash
conda update conda
```

## <a name="install"></a> Installing McClintock
After installing and updating Conda, McClintock can be installed by: **1.** cloning the repository, **2.** creating the Conda environment, and **3.** running the install script

#### Clone McClintock Repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:bergmanlab/mcclintock.git
cd mcclintock
git checkout refactor ## OMIT WHEN REFACTOR BRANCH IS MERGED WITH MASTER
```

#### Create McClintock Conda Environment
```bash
conda env create -f install/envs/mcclintock.yml --name mcclintock
```
* This installs the base dependencies (`Snakemake`, `Python3`, `BioPython`) needed to run the main mcclintock script into the mcclintock Conda environment

#### Activate McClintock Conda Environment
```bash
conda activate mcclintock
```
* This adds the dependencies installed in the mclintock conda environment to the environment `PATH` so that they can be used by the McClintock scripts.
* **This environment must <ins>always</ins> be activated prior to running any of the McClintock scripts**
* *NOTE: Sometimes activating conda environments does not work via `conda activate myenv` when run through a script submitted to a queuing system, this can be fixed by activating the environment in the script as shown below*
```bash
CONDA_BASE=$(conda info --base)
source ${CONDA_BASE}/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
conda activate mcclintock
```
* For more on Conda: see the [Conda User Guide](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html)

#### Install McClintock Component Methods
```
python3 mcclintock.py --install
```
* This command installs each of the TE insertion detection tools and installs a conda environment for each method.

## <a name="run"></a> Running McClintock
Some test data is provided in the `test/` directory, though the fastQ files must be downloaded using the `test/download_test_data.py` script.
```
python test/download_test_data.py
```
* The test data provided is a UCSC sacCer2 yeast reference genome, an annotation of TEs in the yeast reference genome from [Carr, Bensasson and Bergman (2012)](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0050978), and a pair of fastq files from SRA.
  
#### Run McClintock with test data
```
python3 mcclintock.py \
    -r test/sacCer2.fasta \
    -c test/sac_cer_TE_seqs.fasta \
    -g test/reference_TE_locations.gff \
    -t test/sac_cer_te_families.tsv \
    -1 test/SRR800842_1.fastq \
    -2 test/SRR800842_2.fastq \
    -p 4 \
    -o /path/to/output/directory
```
* change `/path/to/output/directory` to a real path where you desire the mcclintock output to be created.
* you can also increase `-p 4` to a higher number if you have more CPU threads available.

## <a name="output"></a> McClintock Output
The results of the component methods are output to the directory `<output>/results`. 
* Summary files from the run can be located at `<output>/results/summary/`. 
* Each component method has raw output files which can be found at `<output>/results/<method>/unfiltered/`. 
* The results are standardized into a bed format and can be found in `<output>/results/<method>/*.bed` where `<output>/results/<method>/*.nonredundant.bed` has any duplicate predictions removed.
* Standardized results are filtered by parameters defined in the `config` files for each method. These config files can be found in `/path/to/mcclintock/config/` and can be modified if you want to adjust the filtering parameters
#### Summary files : `<output>/results/summary/`

* `summary_report.txt` : Summary Report of McClintock run. Contains information on command used, when and where the script was run, details about the mapped reads, and table that shows the number of TE predictions produced from each method
* `te_summary.csv` : a comma-delimited table showing TE predictions (all, reference, non-reference) from each method for each TE family 
* `te_depth.csv` : (Only produced if coverage module is run) a comma-delimited table showing normalized depth for each consensus TE or TE provided in coverage fasta.

#### TrimGalore : `<output>/results/trimgalore/`
* `<fastq>_trimming_report.txt` : Information on parameters used and statistics related to adapter trimming with cutadapt. Provides an overview of sequences removed via the adapter trimming process
* `<fastq>_fastqc.html` : FastQC report of the provided fastq files. Provides information on the results of steps performed by FastQC to assess the quality of the reads provided.
* `<fastq>_fastqc.zip` : FastQC graph images and plain-text summary statistics compressed into a single `.zip` file

#### Coverage : `<output>/results/coverage/`
* `plots/*.png` : Coverage plots showing the normalized read coverage across each TE either from the consensus fasta (`-c`) or the coverage fasta (`-s`) if provided. Unique coverage (MAPQ > 0) is in dark gray, while all coverage (MAPQ >= 0) is in light gray.
* `te-depth-files/*.allQ.cov` : Raw read coverage at each position in a TE sequence. (Output of `samtools depth`)
* `te-depth-files/*.highQ.cov` : coverage of mapped reads with MAPQ > 0 at each position, omitting multi-mapped reads.

#### ngs_te_mapper : `<output>/results/ngs_te_mapper/`
* `unfiltered/<reference>_insertions.bed` : Raw 0-based TSDs for non-reference predictions and 0-based intervals. Reference TE intervals are inferred from the data, not from the reference TE annotations. Strand information is present for both non-reference and reference TEs.
* `<reference>_ngs_te_mapper_nonredundant.bed` : 0-based TSDs for non-reference predictions and 0-based intervals corresponding to the reference TEs. This file contains the same predictions from `unfiltered/<reference>_insertions.bed` with the bed line name adjusted to match the standard McClintock naming convention. By default, no filtering is performed on the raw `ngs_te_mapper` predictions aside from removing redundant predictions, but the config file: (`/path/to/mcclintock/config/ngs_te_mapper/ngs_te_mapper_post.py`) can be modified to increase the minimum read support threshold.

#### RelocaTE : `<output>/results/relocaTE/`
* `unfiltered/combined.gff` : GFF containing 1-based TSDs for non-reference predictions and 1-based intervals for reference TEs. The reference intervals are based on the reference TE annotations.
* `<reference>_relocate_nonredundant.bed` : Predictions from `unfiltered/combined.gff` converted into 0-based intervals with bed line names matching the standard McClintock naming convention. By default, no filtering is performed on the raw predictions aside from removing redundant predictions. However, the config file: (`/path/to/mcclintock/config/relocate/relocate_post.py`) can be modified to increase the minimum left and right prediction support thresholds for both reference and non-reference predictions.

#### RelocaTE2 : `<output>/results/relocaTE2/`
* `unfiltered/repeat/results/ALL.all_ref_insert.gff` : GFF file containing reference TE predictions with 1-based coordinates. The final column also contains read counts supporting the junction (split-read) and read counts supporting the insertion (split pair).
* `unfiltered/repeat/results/ALL.all_nonref_insert.gff` : GFF file containing non-reference TE predictions with 1-based coordinates. The final column also contains read counts supporting the junction (split-read) and read counts supporting the insertion (split pair).
* `<reference>_relocate2_nonredundant.bed` : Contains all reference and non-reference predictions `from ALL.all_ref_insert.gff` and `ALL.all_nonref_insert.gff`. Coordinates are adjusted to be 0-based. By default, no filtering is performed on split-read and split-pair evidence, but the config file: (`/path/to/mcclintock/config/ngs_te_mapper/ngs_te_mapper_post.py`) can be modified to increase the threshold for these values.

#### TEMP : `<output>/results/TEMP/`
* `unfiltered/<reference>.absence.refined.bp.summary` : Tab-delimited table containing reference TEs that are predicted to be absent from the short read data. Position intervals are 1-based.
* `unfiltered/<reference>.insertion.refined.bp.summary` : Tab-delimited table containing non-reference TE predictions. Position intervals are 1-based.
* `<reference>_temp_nonredundant.bed` : Contains all reference TEs not reported as absent by TEMP in the `unfiltered/<reference>.absence.refined.bp.summary` file. Also contains non-reference TE predictions `unfiltered/<reference>.insertion.refined.bp.summary` formatted as a bed line using the McClintock naming convention. Positions for both reference and non-reference predictions are 0-based. Non-reference predictions from `unfiltered/<reference>.insertion.refined.bp.summary` are only added to this file if the prediction has read support on both ends ("1p1") and has a sample frequency of > 10%. These restrictions can be modified in the config file: (`/path/to/mcclintock/config/TEMP/temp_post.py`). Non-reference TEs with split-read support at both ends are marked in the bed line name with "_sr_" and the `Junction1` and `Junction2` columns from `unfiltered/<reference>.insertion.refined.bp.summary` are used as the start and end positions of the TSD in this file (converted to 0-based positions). If the non-reference TE prediction does not have split-read support on both ends of the insertions, the designation "_rp_" is added to the bed line name and the `Start` and `End` columns from `unfiltered/<reference>.insertion.refined.bp.summary` are used as the start and end positions of the TSD in this file (converted to 0-based). Reference insertions are labeled `nonab` in the bed line name.
  
#### RetroSeq : `<output>/results/retroseq/`
* `unfiltered/<reference>.call.PE.vcf` : VCF file containing non-reference TE predictions. Non-reference TEs are annotated as 1-based intervals in the POS column and two consecutive coordinates in the INFO field. No predictions are made for reference TEs. Strand information is not provided.
* `<reference>_retroseq_nonredundant.bed` : Non-reference predictions from `unfiltered/<reference>.call.PE.vcf` with a Breakpoint confidence threshold > 6 are retained in this file. This filtering threshold can be changed by modifying the config file: (`/path/to/mcclintock/config/retroseq/retroseq_post.py`). The position interval reported in the `INFO` column of `unfiltered/<reference>.call.PE.vcf` are converted to 0-based positions and used as the start and end positions in the bed lines in this file.

#### PoPoolationTE : `<output>/results/popoolationTE/`
* `unfiltered/te-poly-filtered.txt` : Tab-delimited table with non-reference and reference TE predictions and support values. Predictions are annotated as 1-based intervals on either end of the predicted insertion, and also as a midpoint between the inner coordinates of the two terminal spans (which can lead to half-base midpoint coordinates)
* `<reference>_popoolationte_nonredundant.bed` : Only predictions with read support on both ends ("FR") and with percent read support > 0.1 for both ends were retained in this file. The entire interval between the inner coordinates of the of the two terminal spans (not the midpoint) was converted to 0-based coordinates. Filtering parameters can be modified in the config file: (`/path/to/mcclintock/config/popoolationte/popoolationte_post.py`)

#### PoPoolationTE2 : `<output>/results/popoolationTE2/`
* `unfiltered/teinsertions.txt` : Tab-delimited table with TE predictions and TE frequency values (ratio of physical coverage supporting a TE insertion to the total physical coverage). PopoolationTE2 does not indicate which predictions are reference and non-reference TEs. Also, only a single position is reported for each prediction, so the TSD is not predicted. Predictions may only have support from one side of the junction ("F" or "R") or both sides ("FR"). Prediction coordinates are 1-based.
* `<reference>_popoolationte2_nonredundant.bed` : This file contains all of the predictions from `unfiltered/teinsertions.txt` that have support on both ends ("FR") and have a frequency greater than "0.1". The filtering criteria can be modified in the config file: (`/path/to/mcclintock/config/popoolationte2/popoolationte2_post.py`). If predictions intersect a TE in the reference genome, that reference TE is reported in this file using the positions of the reference TE. If the prediction does not intersect a reference TE, it is designated a non-reference insertion `_non-reference_`. The coordinates for all predictions are adjusted to be 0-based. 

#### TE-Locate : `<output>/results/te-locate/`
* `unfiltered/te-locate-raw.info` : A tab-delimited table containing reference ("old") and non-reference ("new") predictions using 1-based positions. TSDs are not predicted for non-reference TEs, instead a single position is reported.
* `<reference>_telocate_nonredundant.bed` : Contains all reference and non-reference predictions from `unfiltered/te-locate-raw.info`. Coordinates for both reference and non-reference predictions are converted to a 0-based interval. The Reference TE end position is extended by the `len` column in `unfiltered/te-locate-raw.info`. Non-reference predictions are a single position as te-locate does not predict the TSD size.
